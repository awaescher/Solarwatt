If publishing via the commited pubxml (SundaysFunction\Properties\PublishProfiles) file is not possible, publish to a folder.
This should write the following files and folders:

\bin
\Sundays
host.json

It's sad but true: Copy them filewise to the storage on Azure.
Head to the Azure Function, go to tab "Platform features" and there to "App Service-Editor".
This is a basic file editor. Good luck.
